                    <h2>CORPORATE TRAINING</h2>
                    <div class="line"></div>
                    <h5>Making the case for corporate training</h5>
                    <p>Corporate training has evolved rapidly in recent years to move beyond training just new hires, sales people and leaders. Learning and development professionals and corporate trainers are seen as strategic partners who are critical to the success of their business. Why? Organizations today suffer from a skills gap. And many companies say that it takes 3-5 years to take a seasoned professional and make them productive. This means companies have to train, retrain, and jointly educate employees and managers in order to grow. As millennial take on more responsibility, companies will need to build leadership and communication skills at all levels and in all locations around the world.</p>
                    <h5>How can corporate training help an organization compete?</h5>
                    <p>Formal classroom training is just one way to meet the skills gap. With an explosive growth in technology tools to train people today, the best corporate training programs provide multiple ways people can consume training, both formal and informal. While skills gaps continue to challenge companies, an increased investment in company training programs is good for everyone: employees, businesses and new hires. Organizations want employees who are engaged with their mission, values and vision and who have the skills needed to improve performance. Updating employees’ skills and preparing them for career advancement not only provides a better trained and more productive work force. It also generates higher employee satisfaction and retention.</p>
                    <h5>Finding a corporate training partner</h5>
                    <p>Your corporate training efforts will be successful with the right training development partner.

In addition, we offer a full range of Implementation and Migration in communication, interpersonal, self-management, supervisory, management and leadership skills. All of our workshops are available for on site, blended or virtual delivery.</p>

                        <li>Modelling state-of-the art design, facilitation and management of learning</li>
                        <li>Practical learning by doing, not just by listening</li>

                    <h5>Closing the skills gap</h5>
                    <p>Today more than ever, organizations need a high-functioning corporate training group to help close the ever-widening skills gap that threatens their ability to compete. The Training Institute is the trusted partner of choice for corporate trainers and learning & development professionals worldwide. We provide practical and useful tools to make the job of trainers at all levels in the organization easier and more impactful. Above all, we want to share our expertise and passion for adult learning to help organizations improve performance and close the skill gap!</p>
                    <p>In addition to classes or coursework, many corporate training functions are using certifications in addition to their corporate training programs to drive performance improvement and standards in real-world workplace situations. In-house certifications require both completed coursework and a demonstration of competency that is measured against pre-determined metrics. Corporate training certifications allow employees to achieve recognition for validated proficiency and expertise in achieving business results. A certification distinguishes an employee from their colleagues and can be woven into career development paths, promotions, or assignments on special high profile projects.</p>
